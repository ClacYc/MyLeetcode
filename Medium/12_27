# The question descrition is as follows:

#In a n * m 2-dimension sorted matrix, each row is sorted in ascending order from left to right, besides, each column is sorted in ascending order from top to toe. 

# Please complete an efficient function, in which inputs such a matrix as described above and an integral target number, then determines whether the array contains the integer. 

# I assume this is a vey useful solution and very worth to learn for you !

Complete an efficient function that inputs such a two-dimensional array and an integer, and determines whether the array contains the integer.

class Solution:
    def findNumberIn2DArray(self, matrix: List[List[int]], target: int) -> bool:
        i, j = len(matrix) - 1, 0
        while i >= 0 and j < len(matrix[0]):
            if matrix[i][j] > target: i -= 1
            elif matrix[i][j] < target: j += 1
            else: return True
        return False
